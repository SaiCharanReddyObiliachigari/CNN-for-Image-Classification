# CNN-for-Image-Classification
This is about classification of images using Convolution Neural Networks and performing parameter tuning with different parameters.
Fully connected CNN

Steps Involved:
1) Convolution Layer
2) Pooling Layer
3) Adding one more Convolution Layer
4) Flattening 
5) Full connected network with "Relu" activation function
6) Full connected network with "Sigmoid" activation function 
7) Adam as the optimizer and loss as Binary_crossentropy
8) Finding the best activation function between "Relu" and "Sigmoid".
